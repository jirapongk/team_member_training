Here are three homework ideas based on the topics of Python List Comprehensions, Python Lambda Expressions, and Python Classes and Objects. These exercises are designed to help your team of beginners get hands-on experience with these concepts.

## 1. Python List Comprehension

### Exercise: Data Transformation and Filtering

**Objective:** Use list comprehensions to transform and filter data.

**Task:**
1. Create a list of integers from 1 to 100.
2. Use a list comprehension to generate a new list containing the squares of all even numbers from the original list.
3. Use another list comprehension to create a list of strings that represent the numbers in the original list, but only include numbers that are divisible by 5.

## 2. Python Lambda Expressions

### Exercise: Functional Programming with Lambda

**Objective:** Use lambda expressions to perform simple operations and filtering.

**Task:**
1. Create a list of tuples, each containing a name and an age.
2. Use a lambda function with the `filter` function to create a new list containing only the tuples where the age is greater than 18.
3. Use a lambda function with the `map` function to create a new list of names in uppercase.

## 3. Python Classes and Objects

### Exercise: Creating and Using Classes

**Objective:** Understand the basics of classes and objects by creating a simple class and using its methods.

**Task:**
1. Create a class `Student` with attributes `student_id`, `student_name`, and `student_class`.
2. Add a method to the class that prints all the attributes of a student.
3. Create two instances of the `Student` class and use the method to print their details.

These exercises will help your team get comfortable with list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and object-oriented programming in Python.
